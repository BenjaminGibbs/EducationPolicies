# Social Media Policy v0.1.0

##Intended Use
It is intended that this document is taken by schools and used as their own Social Media Policy. This version includes statements to keep children, teachers and parents safe when using social media, but it is not an exhaustive document and we envisage schools customising the wording to suit their requirements where needed. 

## Definitions

* Must - An absolute requirement.

* Must Not - An absolute prohibition.

* Should - There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

* Should Not - There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing.

* May - Optional.

## Preface
Social media use is increasing worldwide, particularly in the younger generations. We believe it is our duty as a school to harness the opportunity we have to lead from the front and educate our children on best practice and how to stay safe online.

We foster the mentality that everything should be open, transparent and public. Despite many social networks having the option to become private channels, we’re fully aware that nothing online is truly private and we strive to educate our children on this viewpoint.

Our school channels are all public channels. We don’t believe in closed or private groups, as this fosters the mentality of it being okay to have private conversations online, which goes against what we teach our children with regard to online safety and talking to strangers.

## Our Aims
We have three core aims for using social media within school and every action we take should be to support one or more of these aims.
They are:
* To increase engagement between the school and parents/carers.
* To lead from the front and educate our children on best practice when using social media.
* To share and promote our school in a positive light to prospective parents and the wider community.

## Social Networks We Use In School
There are many different social networks, each with a different mission, potential audience and uses. It is unrealistic to assume that we should use every single social network as a school – it would be too time consuming and difficult to manage – but we have considered each platform and actively use those that are most suitable for us and our circumstances.

We believe in having a presence on all social networks regardless of whether we actively use them, since this discourages others from creating accounts which mimic or falsely represent our school.

The school will have a presence on the following social networks: __Add Here__. Where possible, the accounts will be listed as a business or company under the school’s name, rather than as a personal or individual. It is important for us, as a school, to maintain a presence on these platforms to discourage others from creating a derogatory account in our school's name.

The school will actively post on the following social networks: __Add Here__

### Our Accounts
* Facebook: __Add Here__
* Twitter: __Add Here__
* Instagram: __Add Here__

## Usage and Best Practice
To ensure we meet our aims, we have detailed what we consider best practice when using social media within our school.

### Taking Photographs and Videos
This section applies when capturing any content with a camera or microphone, on any device.

#### Must (required)
* All children must be made aware a photo/video is being taken prior to doing so.
*	For safety, we have our own 'capture word' which must be said at all times before a photo or video is taken. This word is iconic to our school and is used to ensure all children know a photo or video is going to be taken. Our word is __Add Here__.
*	There must not be any media taken of a single, identifiable child.
*	There must not be any media taken which contains a child with identifiable features, such as name badges, drawers with names on etc.

#### Should (recommended)
*	When possible, children should be shown the photo or video after it is taken, before it is published online.
*	Photos should either contain no children or groups of 3-6 children, avoiding taking individual children where possible.
* Employees should be aware that photos posted online may be resized by the platform they are uploaded to and so should consider what their photo would appear like if it is cropped either at the sides or the bottom.
* Employees should also ensure they consider the backdrop of the photo or video they are taking, ensuring it is tidy, respectable and shows the school in a positive light.
* Employees should remain sensitive to any children who appear uncomfortable.
