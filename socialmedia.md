# Social Media Policy

## Preface
Social media use is increasing worldwide, particularly in the younger generations. We believe it is our duty as a school to harness the opportunity we have to lead from the front and educate our children on best practice and how to stay safe online.

We foster the mentality that everything should be open, transparent and public. Despite many social networks having the option to become “private” channels, we’re fully aware that nothing online is truly private and we strive to educate our children on this viewpoint.

Our school channels are all public channels. We don’t believe in “closed” or “private” groups, as this fosters the mentality of it being okay to have private conversations online, which goes against what we teach our children with regard to online safety and strangers.

## Part 1: Social Media as a School

### Types of Social Networks

There are many different social networks, each with a different mission, audience and uses. It is unrealistic to assume that we should use every single social network as a school – it would be too time consuming and difficult to manage – but we have considered each platform and actively use those that are most suitable for us and our circumstances.

We believe in having a presence on all social networks regardless of whether we actively use them, since this discourages others from creating accounts which mimic or falsely represent us and our school.

### Social Networks Explained

### Our Social Media Accounts

The school will have a presence on the following social networks: __Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and Youtube__. Where possible, the account will be listed as a business or company under the school’s name, rather than as a personal or individual. It is important for us, as a school, to maintain a presence on these platforms to discourage others from creating a derogatory account in our name.

The school will actively post on the following social networks: __Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.__
Employees at the school are permitted to have personal accounts on any social networks they choose, providing they follow the rules outlines in Part 2 of this document and do not attempt to impersonate the school through an unofficial account.

### General Rules and Restrictions

#### Posting on Social Media
* Content will be posted to official school pages only.
* There will be no content posted to a private page or closed group.
* All posts are considered public, regardless of where they are posted, and should be treated as such.
* The original post must be posted on a school page or account, but can then be shared by others from this place.
* Any photographs or videos taken within school grounds, or during school time, should only be shared to a school account. 

#### Photographs and Video
* Media will be posted to school accounts only.
* If the school keep a list of children who do not have parental consent to be online, this should be cross referenced before every post (and an audit trail of this kept for future reference).
*	All children should be made aware a photo/video is being taken.
*	We have our own “photo word” which must be said at all times before a photo is taken. This word is iconic to our school and is used to ensure all children know a photo is going to be taken. Our photo word is __“Swan”__.
*	Children are always shown the photo after it is taken.
*	There will be no media uploaded which contains one single child.
*	There will be no media uploaded which contains identifiable features, such as name badges, name stickers on books, and so on.

#### Engaging with Parents and Pupils
*	Employees will not engage with parents or pupils via a closed or private account.
*	All interactions must happen publicly and through school official channels only.
*	Staff are encouraged to engage and reply where possible to increase engagement with others, except in the case where children are using a site which is not age-appropriate for them.

#### Passwords
*	Passwords to school social networking accounts should remain safe and secure at all times. For accountability, passwords are not designed to be shared between employees.
*	Social Networks will be managed either through a single person or via a social media management solution in which all users will have their own log in and password. This is to ensure that full accountability exists.

#### Permissions
*	Unless stated otherwise, all media content obtained by employees remains the employees content. Employees may grant the school access to the content for distribution on social networks.
*	All media uploaded must be owned by the school before it can be uploaded.

#### Managing Social Networks
*	We have assigned our social media specialist as __Mr Anonymous__.
* We endeavour to ensure all content is moderated to ensure consistency and to ensure our posts paint the school in a positive light. 

## Part 2: Protecting our Staff Online

### General Rules for Employees
*	Where possible, all social accounts which are personal to staff members must have two factor authentication on their account to avoid misuse by others.
*	Passwords on personal accounts must remain private and not be shared.
*	Employees are encouraged to always treat posts as public, even if an account has privacy settings enabled, as posts can always be screenshotted and shared. 
*	Employees are advised not to connect with parents and carers who are associated with the school via their personal accounts.
*	Employees may use personal devices to create content for social media, but any content should be kept on the device for the minimum amount of time feasible, up to a maximum of a week.
*	Any personal devices used to hold content from school must be secured with a password or pin.
